Making computers listen ! I was working way to much on making computer see so I figured out why not make them listen as well

<br>
I can use cnn for this (MFCC's') <br>
convert wav files to spectrograms and use them to train the model (??) 
I think converting audio to spectrograms it should give kind of good results 

### TODO
* learn about speech (cause I know nothing about it)
* read some reseach paper on speech stuff
* use wandb to plot and stuff ditch tensorflow completely
* use torch audio to accelerate learning 
* learn about spectrograms, MFCC and other sound related stuff

### Learnings
* Mel spectrograms

### --------- 
this is a cool project to learn about speech and stuff
